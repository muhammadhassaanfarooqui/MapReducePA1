Some of rows had empty entries
Some of the rows had invalid entries for example number plates that were consisting of only one character or some plates made no sense like BLAQMAX.
Some of the rows were empty and some had other values indicating null values like -1s and 'N/A's.
Some of the entries had commas embedded inside them with double quotes on the sides. So the values were difficult to split.
